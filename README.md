# Leap-Year-Checker

A simple C program that checks whether a given year is a leap year or not.

The program prompts the user to enter a year and then determines if the year is:

- Leap year (divisible by 4, but not by 100, or divisible by 400)
- Not a leap year (not meeting the leap year conditions)
